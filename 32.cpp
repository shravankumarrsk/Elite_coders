/*
Chocolate Distribution Problem

Given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among m students such that -
      i. Each student gets exactly one packet.
     ii. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number is minimum and return that minimum possible difference.

Examples:

Input: arr = [3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12], m = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The minimum difference between maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates is 9 - 3 = 6 by choosing m packets as [3, 4, 9, 7, 9
